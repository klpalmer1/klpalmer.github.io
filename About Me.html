<h1><u>About <em>Me</em></u><em></em></h1>
<p class="body">Hi! I currently work at UNC Chapel Hill in Accounting and decided to make a jump into Tech. I have a varied background in Science, Psychology, Accounting, and soon-to-be...Tech! At some point in the future I hope to move into Film and perhaps move to the West Coast. This website is part of my portfolio to showcase what I've learned in my Web Development class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="body">Fun Fact: I drove the GoodYear blimp before I learned how to drive a car. It was definitely a cool experience, and I was in 2nd grade!</p>
